# vms
Vehicle management system - it's a system where you can store data about vehicles. 

This project is using generic and reflection which helps to not repeating code. For example we don't have to write a code for every model to modify its fields. We have to modify 2 files(VehicleMethods and VehicleConverter) only if we add/delete file in model package.
