Vehicle management system - it's a system where you can store data about vehicles. 

This project is using generic and reflection which helps to not repeating code. For example we don't have to write a code for every model to modify its fields. We only have to change switch case statements in VehicleConverter and VehicleMethods files if files of models changes(like we add/delete model file).
